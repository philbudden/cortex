# Reviews

This folder is for **evaluations and reflections**.

## Purpose

Review notes capture:
- Evaluations of ideas or drafts
- Comparisons of alternatives
- Retrospectives on projects
- Structured feedback

## When to Create a Review

Create a review when:
- You need to evaluate an idea before committing
- You're comparing multiple options (projects, arguments, sources)
- You want structured feedback on a draft
- You're reflecting on what worked or didn't

## Structure

A review typically includes:
- **What's being evaluated**: Idea, draft, project, source
- **Criteria**: Explicit standards or rubric
- **Strengths**: What works well
- **Weaknesses**: What needs work
- **Questions**: Unresolved issues
- **Recommendation**: Next steps or overall assessment (optional)

Use `06_Templates/review.md` as a starting point.

## AI Assistant Role

An AI can help you:
- Evaluate against explicit criteria
- Surface strengths and weaknesses
- Compare alternatives
- Apply scoring rubrics

See `.agents/review.md` and `.agents/scoring.md` for details.

## Tips

- **Use explicit criteria**: Define standards before evaluating
- **Be specific**: Point to concrete examples
- **Distinguish fact from preference**: Separate objective issues from taste
- **Frame constructively**: Weaknesses are opportunities, not failures

## File Naming

Use descriptive names tied to what's being reviewed:
- `trust-mechanisms-outline-review.md`
- `project-ideas-comparison.md`
- `q1-2026-retrospective.md`

## Scoring (Optional)

For structured evaluation, use scoring rubrics.

Example:
- Clarity (1-3)
- Feasibility (1-3)
- Impact (1-3)

See `.agents/scoring.md` for guidance on creating and applying rubrics.
