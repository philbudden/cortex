# Review: Trust Mechanisms Essay (Outline)

**Reviewed:** 2026-02-17  
**Type:** Draft outline  
**Criteria:** Argument strength, clarity, feasibility

## Strengths

- Clear thesis: trust as infrastructure, not feeling
- Good hook: established market mechanisms as analogy
- Logical structure: how markets work → why AI is different → what might work
- Avoids oversimplification (acknowledges differences)

## Weaknesses

- Section 3 is underdeveloped (marked TODO—good)
- No AI safety sources yet; market analysis is solid but second half needs research
- Conclusion is vague; needs a sharper ending
- Risk: the analogy might break down under scrutiny—need to acknowledge limits explicitly

## Questions

- Is the audience definition too narrow? Could this work for a general reader?
- Should Section 2 come before Section 1 (problem-first structure)?
- What's the specific action or insight I want readers to leave with?
- Am I arguing for specific AI trust mechanisms, or just diagnosing the problem?

## Recommendation

Solid foundation. Before drafting prose:

1. Research AI safety trust mechanisms (formal verification, interpretability, etc.)
2. Decide if this is diagnostic or prescriptive
3. Sharpen the conclusion—what should readers think or do differently?
4. Consider testing the market analogy with someone unfamiliar with the domain

Not ready to write yet, but outline is headed in the right direction.
