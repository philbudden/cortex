# Research

This folder contains **source summaries and reference material**.

## Purpose

Research notes capture:
- Books, articles, papers, talks
- Key arguments and evidence from sources
- Citations and metadata for retrieval
- Your reactions and connections to other work

## Structure

Each research note should include:
- **Bibliographic metadata**: Author, title, date, URL/DOI
- **Summary**: 2-4 sentences on the main argument
- **Key points**: Main claims or findings
- **Quotes**: Important passages (sparingly)
- **Relevance**: Why this matters to your work (optional)
- **Links**: Connections to notes or writing projects

Use `06_Templates/research-note.md` as a starting point.

## When to Create a Research Note

Create a research note when:
- You read something worth remembering
- You need to cite a source later
- You want to extract ideas from external work
- You're building a bibliography for a writing project

## AI Assistant Role

An AI can help you:
- Summarise sources accurately
- Extract key arguments and evidence
- Format citations consistently
- Link research findings to your notes or writing

See `.agents/research.md` for details.

## Tips

- **Faithful capture**: Represent sources accurately, even if you disagree
- **Concise summaries**: Shorter than the original
- **Quote precisely**: Use exact wording when quoting
- **Note your reactions separately**: Distinguish source content from your thoughts

## File Naming

Use descriptive names based on author and topic:
- `akerlof-lemons-1970.md`
- `kahneman-thinking-fast-slow.md`
- `brandolini-bullshit-asymmetry.md`

Avoid generic names like `paper-1.md` or `book-notes.md`.
