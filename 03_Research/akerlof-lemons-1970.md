# The Market for Lemons

**Author:** George A. Akerlof  
**Date:** 1970  
**Type:** Paper  
**URL/DOI:** [Quarterly Journal of Economics]

## Summary

Akerlof demonstrates how information asymmetry can cause market failure. When buyers cannot distinguish quality, they pay only average prices. This drives high-quality sellers out of the market, leaving only "lemons" (defective goods). The result is adverse selection and potential market collapse.

## Key Points

- **Information asymmetry**: Sellers know quality; buyers don't
- **Adverse selection**: Bad products drive out good ones
- **Market failure**: The market for high-quality goods disappears
- **Trust mechanism needed**: Warranties, reputation, or regulation

## Quotes

> "The presence of people who wish to pander false wares and defraud buyers will tend to drive legitimate business out of existence."

## My Notes

This is the foundational paper for understanding how trust breaks down in markets. Highly relevant to any system where quality is hard to verify—including AI systems.

## Relevance

Directly applicable to:
- [[information-asymmetry]] note
- Trust in markets thinking
- Potential AI safety parallels
