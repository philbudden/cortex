# Inbox

This folder is for **raw, unprocessed content**.

Drop anything here:
- Quick thoughts
- Clippings from articles
- Random ideas
- Fragments that don't yet have a home

No structure required. No judgment. Just capture.

## Processing Inbox

When you're ready to organise:

1. Review items one by one
2. Decide where each belongs:
   - `01_Daily/` — If it's a dated reflection
   - `02_Notes/` — If it's an evergreen idea
   - `03_Research/` — If it's a source to summarise
   - `04_Writing/` — If it's a writing seed
   - `99_Archive/` — If it's no longer relevant
3. Move or refactor the content
4. Delete the inbox item (or archive it)

The inbox is temporary. Don't let it pile up forever.
