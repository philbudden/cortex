## Instructions

- **Start with an outline**: Don't write prose until structure is clear
- **Work section-by-section**: Complete one section before moving to the next
- **Mark incomplete sections**: Use `[TODO]` or `[DRAFT]` for placeholders
- **Link to sources**: Connect to research notes instead of citing inline
- **Iterate**: Outlines change as you write—that's normal

This is a working document. Keep it messy until it's ready to polish.
