## Instructions

- **Events**: What happened today worth noting
- **Ideas**: Thoughts, insights, questions that emerged
- **Notes**: Observations, reflections, fragments
- **To Process**: Items that need to be moved elsewhere (Inbox, Notes, Research, Writing)

Keep daily notes messy. They're for capture, not polish.
Extract worthwhile ideas into `02_Notes/` later.
