## Instructions

- **One idea per note**: If you need subsections, you probably need multiple notes
- **Descriptive title**: Use clear, searchable names
- **Self-contained**: Anyone should understand this without reading other notes
- **Linkable**: This note should be reusable in multiple contexts
- **Evergreen**: Focus on timeless ideas, not dated references

Front-matter is optional but helpful for filtering and organisation.

**Tags:** Use 1-3 tags maximum, only when filtering would be useful. Prefer descriptive titles and wiki-links over extensive tagging.
