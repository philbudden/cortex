# Archive

This folder contains **deprecated or completed material**.

Content here is:
- **Read-only by default**: Don't edit unless explicitly instructed
- **Preserved for context**: Historical record, completed projects, outdated drafts
- **Not actively used**: If you're referencing it often, it probably shouldn't be archived

## What to Archive

- Finished essays or articles (after publication)
- Abandoned drafts or ideas
- Notes superseded by better versions
- Research that's no longer relevant
- Completed projects

## What Not to Archive

- Active drafts (belongs in `04_Writing/`)
- Useful evergreen notes (belongs in `02_Notes/`)
- Sources you might reference again (belongs in `03_Research/`)

## AI Assistant Role

- Do not modify archive contents unless explicitly asked
- Archive can be referenced for context
- Suggest archiving outdated content from other folders

This is preservation, not deletion.
