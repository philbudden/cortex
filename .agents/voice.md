# Voice Skill

## Intent

Ensure AI-generated or AI-edited text matches the author's voice and tone.

## Scope

This skill applies **across all writing tasks**, especially:
- Expanding outlines in `04_Writing/`
- Improving prose clarity
- Drafting sections based on notes

It is **not** a standalone skill—it informs `writing.md`, `research.md`, and `review.md`.

## Core Principle

**The AI does not have a voice. The human does.**

Every author sounds different. The job of the AI is to:
- Identify patterns in the author's existing writing
- Match those patterns when generating or editing text
- Avoid imposing generic "AI voice" or "house style"

## What Voice Includes

- **Sentence structure**: Short and punchy vs. long and complex
- **Word choice**: Formal vs. casual, technical vs. accessible
- **Rhythm**: Varied vs. consistent pacing
- **Tone**: Confident, exploratory, skeptical, playful, serious
- **Perspective**: First person, third person, "we," impersonal

## How to Identify Voice

1. **Read existing writing by the author**
   - Look for patterns in sentence length
   - Note recurring phrases or constructions
   - Identify tone and register

2. **When in doubt, ask**
   - "Should this section be more formal or conversational?"
   - "Do you prefer active or passive voice here?"

3. **Default to minimal intervention**
   - If the author's draft is rough but has a clear voice, preserve it
   - Don't sand off stylistic edges

## Red Flags: Generic AI Voice

Avoid these tells:
- Over-explaining simple concepts
- Hedging everything ("it's worth noting that," "it's important to remember")
- Formulaic structures ("In conclusion," "As we've seen")
- Buzzwords or jargon where simpler words work
- Forced enthusiasm or motivational language
- Overly smooth, frictionless prose

## Examples

### ✅ Good: Matching voice

**Author's existing style (from their drafts):**
> Markets fail when information is asymmetric. Buyers can't verify quality. Sellers won't disclose defects. Trust collapses.

**AI expansion (matching voice):**
> Markets fail when information is asymmetric. Buyers can't verify product quality before purchase. Sellers have no incentive to disclose defects. Trust collapses, and with it, the possibility of efficient exchange.

*(Short sentences, active voice, punchy rhythm preserved.)*

### ❌ Bad: Imposing generic voice

**Author's existing style:**
> Markets fail when information is asymmetric. Buyers can't verify quality. Sellers won't disclose defects. Trust collapses.

**AI expansion (wrong voice):**
> It's important to understand that markets can experience failure when there exists asymmetry in the distribution of information between participants. In such cases, buyers may find themselves unable to adequately verify the quality of goods or services, while sellers, operating rationally, have limited incentive to voluntarily disclose defects or shortcomings. This dynamic can lead to an erosion of trust, which is, of course, fundamental to the functioning of any healthy market system.

*(Overly formal, hedging, passive constructions, verbose—completely different voice.)*

## Calibration Process

When working with a new author:

1. **Sample their writing**
   - Read several pieces across different topics
   - Note consistent patterns

2. **Test and adjust**
   - Generate a small sample
   - Ask for feedback
   - Refine based on response

3. **Document preferences**
   - If the author gives explicit guidance ("I always use first person," "I avoid jargon"), note it
   - Save in this file or a separate voice profile (optional)

## Author-Specific Voice Notes

*(This section can be customised by the author.)*

If you have specific voice preferences, document them here:

- Sentence length:
- Preferred perspective (I, we, one, passive):
- Formality level:
- Technical depth:
- Tone:
- Words/phrases to avoid:
- Words/phrases to favor:

## When to Apply This Skill

- Anytime you're generating or editing prose
- Especially when expanding outlines or drafting new sections
- When the author asks for stylistic consistency

## When Not to Apply This Skill

- Quotes from sources (use original voice)
- Technical documentation where standardisation matters
- Templates or forms
