## Events

- Team meeting on Q1 roadmap
- Finished reading chapter 3 of "Thinking in Systems"
- Coffee with Sarah—discussed her new project

## Ideas

- Feedback loops in organizations mirror natural systems
- Fast feedback = faster learning, but also faster mistakes
- Need to distinguish between reinforcing and balancing loops

## Notes

- Sarah's project: AI tool for legal document review
  - Trust problem: how do lawyers verify AI didn't miss something?
  - Similar to market information asymmetry
  - Maybe worth exploring further

- Meadows quote: "The purpose of a system is what it does, not what we say it does"
  - Provocative framing
  - Applies to corporate culture discussions

## To Process

- [ ] Extract note on feedback loops
- [ ] Connect systems thinking to trust mechanisms essay
- [ ] Follow up with Sarah about her AI trust problem
