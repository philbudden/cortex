# Daily Notes

This folder is for **daily journaling and reflection**.

## Format

Create one note per day using the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Example: `2026-02-17.md`

## Purpose

Daily notes are for:
- Capturing what happened
- Recording ideas that emerged
- Noting observations or reflections
- Listing items to process later

They are **not** for:
- Polished writing
- Permanent knowledge storage
- Long-form drafts

## Workflow

1. **Create a daily note** (or use `06_Templates/daily-note.md` as a starting point)
2. **Write freely** throughout the day
3. **Review periodically** (weekly or monthly)
4. **Extract worthwhile ideas** into `02_Notes/` or other folders
5. **Archive old daily notes** if desired (optional)

## AI Assistant Role

An AI can help you:
- Summarise a day, week, or month of daily notes
- Identify patterns or recurring themes
- Extract ideas worth developing into standalone notes
- Suggest connections to existing knowledge

See `.agents/refactoring.md` for details.

## Tips

- Keep it messy—this is for capture, not presentation
- Don't overthink structure
- Link to other notes if relevant: `[[note-name]]`
- Use daily notes as a staging area for ideas that need time to develop
