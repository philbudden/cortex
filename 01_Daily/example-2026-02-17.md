## Events

- Started building out the Cortex vault structure
- Clarified thinking on skills vs. prompts

## Ideas

- Skills as **behavioural contracts** rather than configuration feels right
- The vault should work perfectly without AI—that's the test
- Keep fighting the urge to over-engineer

## Notes

- Markdown as interface: simple, boring, durable
- If it needs an API, we've failed
- The best tools disappear

## To Process

- [ ] Draft essay on "boring infrastructure for thinking"
- [ ] Extract note on skill design principles
