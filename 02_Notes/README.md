# Notes

This folder contains **atomic, evergreen notes**.

## What Are Atomic Notes?

Atomic notes are:
- **Focused**: One idea per note
- **Self-contained**: Understandable without reading other notes
- **Reusable**: Can be linked from multiple contexts
- **Timeless**: Not tied to specific dates or events

## Structure

Each note should:
- Have a clear, descriptive title
- Explain the core idea in 2-4 sentences
- Include examples or evidence if helpful
- Link to related notes

Use `06_Templates/atomic-note.md` as a starting point.

## When to Create a Note

Create a note when:
- An idea is worth keeping long-term
- You might reference this idea in multiple contexts
- A concept is distinct enough to stand alone
- You've extracted a useful insight from daily notes, inbox, or research

## AI Assistant Role

An AI can help you:
- Extract atomic notes from messy sources
- Improve clarity without changing meaning
- Suggest links to related notes
- Identify duplicate or overlapping notes

See `.agents/refactoring.md` for details.

## Tips

- **Start simple**: A few sentences is enough
- **Link liberally**: Connect related ideas with `[[note-name]]`
- **Refine over time**: Notes can evolve as you learn more
- **Don't force it**: Not every thought needs to be a note

## Examples

Good note titles:
- `information-asymmetry.md`
- `trust-in-markets.md`
- `feedback-loops.md`

Bad note titles:
- `note-001.md` (not descriptive)
- `ideas-from-book.md` (too broad)
- `random-thoughts.md` (not atomic)
