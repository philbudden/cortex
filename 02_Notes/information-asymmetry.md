# Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry occurs when one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other. This creates an imbalance that can lead to market failure.

## The Problem

When buyers cannot verify the quality of goods before purchase, they must assume average quality. Sellers of high-quality goods cannot credibly signal quality, so they receive only average prices. This drives high-quality goods out of the market, leaving only low-quality "lemons."

Eventually, buyers adjust expectations downward, prices fall further, and the market collapses.

## Examples

- Used car markets (Akerlof's original example)
- Insurance markets (adverse selection)
- Employment (hidden effort or shirking)
- Financial markets (insider trading)

## Solutions

- **Warranties**: Seller guarantees quality
- **Reputation**: Repeated interaction builds trust
- **Third-party verification**: Inspections, certifications, ratings
- **Regulation**: Mandatory disclosure requirements
