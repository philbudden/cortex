# Writing

This folder is for **long-form drafts and essays**.

## Purpose

Writing notes are:
- Essays, articles, blog posts
- Book chapters or sections
- Long-form arguments or narratives
- Works in progress

## Structure

Start with an outline, then develop sections incrementally.

A typical writing file includes:
- **Thesis**: What are you arguing or exploring?
- **Audience**: Who is this for?
- **Outline**: Section-by-section structure
- **Sources**: Links to research notes
- **Notes to self**: Questions, gaps, TODOs

Use `06_Templates/writing-draft.md` as a starting point.

## Workflow

1. **Start with an outline**
   - Define thesis and audience
   - Break into sections
   - Identify sources

2. **Work section-by-section**
   - Draft one section at a time
   - Mark incomplete sections with `[TODO]` or `[DRAFT]`
   - Link to research and notes for support

3. **Revise incrementally**
   - Improve structure and flow
   - Refine prose
   - Check for consistency

4. **Finish and publish**
   - Final polish
   - Move to `99_Archive/` when published (optional)

## AI Assistant Role

An AI can help you:
- Expand outlines into prose
- Improve structure and flow
- Maintain consistent voice
- Work section-by-section

See `.agents/writing.md` and `.agents/voice.md` for details.

## Tips

- **Keep drafts incomplete**: Don't try to finish everything at once
- **Work top-down**: Outline before prose
- **Link to sources**: Reference research notes instead of inline citations
- **Expect iteration**: First drafts are rough—that's normal

## File Naming

Use working titles that describe the content:
- `trust-mechanisms-essay.md`
- `market-failure-explainer.md`
- `ai-safety-intro-chapter.md`

Avoid generic names like `draft-1.md` or `essay.md`.
