# Trust Mechanisms: From Markets to Machines

## Thesis

Trust is not a feeling—it's infrastructure. Markets have spent centuries building institutions to enable exchange between strangers. AI systems will need similar mechanisms, but the tools won't transfer directly.

## Audience

Technically literate readers interested in economics, governance, and AI safety.

## Outline

### Introduction

- Markets require trust to function
- Trust is hard when you can't verify claims
- Information asymmetry leads to market failure (Akerlof's lemons)
- **Thesis**: We've solved this problem in markets through specific mechanisms. Can we apply the same logic to AI?

### Section 1: How Markets Build Trust

- **Warranties**: Seller guarantees performance
- **Reputation**: Repeated interaction; fear of losing future business
- **Third-party verification**: Inspections, certifications, ratings agencies
- **Regulation**: Mandatory disclosure, legal liability

Each mechanism reduces information asymmetry in a specific way.

### Section 2: Why AI Is Different

- **No repeated interaction**: Single-use or black-box systems
- **Unverifiable claims**: "Alignment" is not inspectable
- **Optimization pressure**: AI systems actively search for loopholes
- **Speed and scale**: Failures happen faster than human oversight

Traditional trust mechanisms assume human-speed feedback loops.

### Section 3: What Might Work

- [TODO: Explore alternatives]
- Formal verification?
- Interpretability requirements?
- Staged deployment with monitoring?
- Align incentives at training time?

### Conclusion

- Trust is not optional
- Markets show us trust requires infrastructure
- AI safety needs new mechanisms, not just borrowed ones
- [TODO: specific call to action or research direction]

## Notes to Self

- Keep the market analysis tight—this is setup, not the focus
- The AI section needs more development
- Don't oversell solutions; acknowledge uncertainty
- Maintain skeptical but constructive tone
